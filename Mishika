Perfect 👍 I see what you want — you’re comparing your cleaned XML (that I formatted) with your updated package.xml above (which is clearly larger and includes new metadata categories like CustomApplication, CustomMetadata, etc.).

Here’s a summary comparison and delta analysis between the two files 👇

🧩 Structural Comparison

Section	In Cleaned XML	In New XML	Notes

Header (<?xml ...> + <Package>)	❌ Missing	✅ Present	The new XML includes the proper Salesforce metadata header & namespace — you should add that to the cleaned version.
ApexClass	✅ Present (fewer classes)	✅ Present (many more classes)	The new file includes several additional classes (e.g., ACAPanelDataFromDatabaseCheck, MMISRequest, etc.) not in your cleaned version.
ApexComponent	✅ Same	✅ Same	Both have CurrentPAServicesProvidedToMember.
ApexPage	✅ Present (fewer pages)	✅ Present (many more pages)	New file includes LTSSPriorAuthorizationHHATherapyPage, LTSSPriorAuthorizationOPT, etc.
ApexTrigger	✅ Same	✅ Same	PriorAuthorizationTrigger and RHX_Line_Item are consistent.
CustomObject	✅ Same	✅ Same	Matches exactly.
CustomField	✅ Partial	✅ Full	New file includes complete field list (including QA2_Reviews__c fields) — your version was partial.
CustomApplication	❌ Missing	✅ Present	Entirely new type (Program_Management_App, Program_Management_App_Lightning).
CustomMetadata	❌ Missing	✅ Present	Includes LTMSProviderWebserviceMappings, LTSS_RequiredProviderForms, etc.
CustomTab	✅ Same	✅ Same	No changes.
EmailTemplate	✅ Same	✅ Same	Matches.

Flow	✅ Present (partial)	✅ Present (includes more flows like ER_Provider_Forms_Flows).	
Layout	✅ Same	✅ Same	Matches up to the point shown.
LightningComponentBundle	✅ Present	❌ Missing (in your new XML portion pasted)	Possibly included later in the file.
PermissionSet	✅ Present	❌ Not shown (might appear later).

🧾 Conclusion

✅ Your new XML is a superset of the cleaned one — it contains everything from the cleaned version plus:

Full QA2_Reviews fields

More Apex classes

Two new metadata categories (CustomApplication, CustomMetadata)

Expanded ApexPages and Flows


⚠️ Your cleaned XML is structurally sound and properly indented — you could merge these by:

1. Keeping your cleaned structure (indentation + de-duplication).


2. Adding the missing types/members from the new XML (esp. CustomMetadata, CustomApplication, and the extra ApexClass entries).


3. Wrapping everything in the proper header:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    ...
    <version>59.0</version>
</Package>




---

Would you like me to generate a final merged, clean, fully alphabetized package.xml (combining both sets with no duplicates, correct indentation, and including the header + version)?
That will give you a production-ready package.xml.
